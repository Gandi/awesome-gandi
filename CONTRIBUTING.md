# Contributing Guidelines

If you don't want to mess with GitHub too much or do not feel confident
creating a pull request, it is already useful to [create an Issue](https://github.com/nlewo/awesome-gandi/issues)
to provide information on what you think is missing in this repository.

You can also create a pull request following a few guidelines:

- Search through the previous pull requests before making a new one! üôè
- Make sure you've personally used or benefited from the suggested resource.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[Resource Title](url) ‚Äî description.`
- Expand on why the resource is useful in your pull request if needed.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive. 
- Double check your spelling and grammar! üòÅ
- Keep entries sorted alphabetically by the title.
